# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The original package name 'com.attendances.Attendances-App-Backend' is invalid and this project uses 'com.attendances.AttendancesAppBackend' instead.

# First steps - Folders Creation
First of all we need to create a number of folders(packages) in our project package (" src/main/java/com.** "):


- models
  - We will define our classes to every model of the project
    - Attendance
    - Classroom
    - Student
- repository
- service
- controller

## Models & MySQL Relations

First of all we need a global model with the info that will be stored in our database. We will declare three models to operate:
- Student **(Every student can own more than one attendance or none of them. Relation with student type: One to many)**
  - id
  - name
  - secondName
  - studentCode
  - Attendance list
  
- Attendance **(Relation with student type: Many to one)**
  - id
  - studentIncome (local date)
  - incomeConfirmation
  - exitConfirmation
  - Student
  
- Classroom
  - id
  - classroomName
  - Student list **(A classroom has many students. Relation with student type: One to many)**


## Connection to Mysql
To connect to the database we need to write the following code in our **resources/application.properties**
```
# Connect to the database url
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_attendances_spring

# login username of the database ( in this case is a root user)
spring.datasource.username=root

# login with user database's password
spring.datasource.password=root

spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update


logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=debug
```


## Repositories

We are going to create a couple of java interfaces called:
 - "ClassroomRepo"
 - "AttendanceRepo"
 - "StudentRepo"

This interfaces extends from JpaRepository interface to access to the C.R.U.D methods.
It needs to pass our "T" class (in this case is our Attendance class) and a public class as the Id variable ( in this case we declared our user 'Id' as 'private Long')
- example:

  ```
  public interface AttendanceRepo extends JpaRepository<Attendance, Long>{
    /*
    * Method to search by student(student_code) and attendance(studentIncome)
    * Name must follow the next format:
    * findBy + table + _tableAttribute + And + _secondParametter
    * "findByStudent_StudentCodeAndStudentIncome"
    * We pass as arguments our studentCode as "String code" and the LocalDate studentIncome as "LocalDate incomeDate"
    *
    * More info: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-query-keywords
    *
    * Attendance could not exist so it must be optional
    * */
  
    Optional<Attendance> findByStudent_StudentCodeAndStudentIncome(String code, LocalDate incomeDate);
  }
  ```
  
## Service
We're going to create a java class and an interface called:
- **ClassroomService**
- It will host our declared methods to be defined in the 'ClassroomServiceImpl' class:
  ```
  public interface ClassroomService {
    /*
    * Declared methods to define in the implementation class
    * */
    Optional<Classroom> searchClassroomById(Long id);
    Optional<Attendance> searchAttendanceByCode(String code);
    Optional<Student> searchStudentByCode(String code);
  
    void registerAttendance(Attendance attendance);
    void updateAttendance(Attendance attendance);
  }
  ```
  - **ClassroomServiceImpl** 
    - It will contain the ClassroomService methods definitions. This code will operate with our data to be stored in the database:
    ```
    public class ClassroomServiceImpl implements ClassroomService{

      // variables with final will be passed through the constructor
      private final AttendanceRepo attendanceRepo;
      private final StudentRepo studentRepo;
      private final ClassroomRepo classroomRepo;


      // ClassroomService Methods to define
  
      @Override
      public Optional<Classroom> searchClassroomById(Long id) {
          // calling Jpa method extended in classroomRepo class to  find by id
          return classroomRepo.findById(id);
      }

      @Override
      public Optional<Attendance> searchAttendanceByCode(String code) {
          // create a local variable wit the actual date
          LocalDate actualDate = LocalDate.now();
          // calling AttendanceRepo method
          return attendanceRepo.findByStudent_StudentCodeAndStudentIncome(code, actualDate);
      }

      @Override
      public Optional<Student> searchStudentByCode(String code) {
          // calling StudentRepo method
          return studentRepo.findByStudentCode(code);
      }

      @Override
      public void registerAttendance(Attendance attendance) {
          // set values to the class
          LocalDate actualDate = LocalDate.now();
          attendance.setStudentIncome(actualDate);
          attendance.setIncomeConfirmation(true);
          attendance.setExitConfirmation(false);
  
          // save into the database
          attendanceRepo.save(attendance);
      }

      @Override
      public void updateAttendance(Attendance attendance) {
          // update an attendance is to inform that student has gone so 'exitConfirmation' must be true
          attendance.setExitConfirmation(true);
  
          // save into the database
          attendanceRepo.save(attendance);
      }
    }
